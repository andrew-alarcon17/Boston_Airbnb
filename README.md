### Motivation

As someone who has used Airbnb before, I personally know that it can be a little overwhelming at times to try to narrow down on which Airbnb would be perfect to stay in for a few days for a vacation. So, I wanted to focus on which neighborhoods would be best to choose from in Boston, mainly based on their average user score, what was said about them in the comments, and how much they go for in terms of price.

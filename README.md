### Libraries Used in this Notebook:

### Motivation

As someone who has used Airbnb before, I personally know that it can be a little overwhelming at times to try to narrow down on which Airbnb would be perfect to stay in for a few days for a vacation. So, I wanted to focus on which neighborhoods would be best to choose from in Boston, mainly based on their average user score, what was said about them in the comments, and how much they go for in terms of price.


## Data Description

The data is comprised of three separate csv files:

Reviews - Contains the user reviews people have left for homes based on listing_id.

Listings - Contains data on all of the Airbnb homes. Such data includes descriptions, house rules, price, neighborhood, score, and much more.

Calendar -  Includes the listing id, price, and the availability for that day.
